<h5>   Multi-Part Utility Upload  </h5>
<p> Amazon S3 provides a faster, easier, and more flexible method to upload larger files, known as the multipart upload feature. This feature allows you to break the larger objects into smaller chunks and upload several chunks in parallel. If any of the chunks fail to upload, you can restart it. </p>
